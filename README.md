# AND_APP

For our bacelor's project we are working on a web application for the time capsule concept that you are already familiar with.
I was thinking to make the app version of our project for this course assignment. But I am affraid that the scope and ambition
level might be too high. I was thinking to focus more on a MVP (minimum viable product). The requirements written bellow are 
the ones for the time capsule bacheleor's project. I have prioritized them according to MoSCoW method and the MVP could consist
of the M (must) requirements alongside with a few S (should). An alternative would be to create an app where I want to explore 
a few features of the Android OS, such as the dial fuction, SMS, location, camera. And combine them in some way, and maybe add 
a few extra functionality features to cover more of the curriculum topics, in order to make the course assignment project.
